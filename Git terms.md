# Git terms
- **Workspace**  
Workspace is a working environment.
- **Index**  
Index is an environment, on your PC, that you publish your changes to piecemeal. If you have many changes to make in a few days and don't want to move them to a local or online repository, you move them to index at the end of every workday or whenever you want. 
- **Local repository**  
Local repository is a .git hidden folder inside workspace. Initialized on the stage of project creation.
- **Online repository**  
Online repository is a space where you publish your changes for the future app production, team collaboration, and where the code, actually, gets executed; repository on GitHub.
